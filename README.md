# Public Opinion Regarding the Houseless Populations of Three Major Cities
## Analysis of wordclouds produced through the use of a Twitter API crawler and geo-tagged tweets
###### Seattle / New York City / San Francisco

In an effort to understand the general public opinion of Twitter users living in cities with major houseless populations, I used the search terms **houseless** and **homeless** to account for variations in vocabulary and changes in acceptable ways to refer to this marginalized population. As the wealth gap in the United States widens,
seemingly without any signs of slowing down, the economic disparity is most clearly visualized in the growing populations of houseless people in almost every major city in the country. Governmental policy can be shaped by the voters who reside in these effected cities, but those with extreme financial means and stake in the game tend to have a little bit more swaying power. Still, public opinion has influence especially when residents can reach a consensus on the issue at hand. For this reason, I carried out this project to examine the similarities and differences between wordclouds built with tweets from NYC, Seattle, and San Francisco. 

#### WordClouds

*San Francisco*

*New York City*

The list of tweets for each individual city was extensive, indicating that the houseless crisis is apparent to a majority of people and a topic of discussion. The discourses differ slightly from city to city, but the words the appear in the word clouds are strikingly similar for the most part. The biggest difference of note are the names of city representatives referenced in the tweets gathered. Some of the word clouds for one city even refer the other cities in this report. For example, the word cloud for Seattle contains "SF", "San", and "Francisco." Besides these minute differences, the word clouds share some major concepts. All of them refer to death, drugs and safety. Terms like "crime", "illegal", and "violence" appear in most, along with words like "help", "government", and "social."
The fact that there is so much variation within each word cloud, but similar patterns across them all, indicates a national problem of disensus. The crisis is the same in each city and that is apparent, but the way people refer to it and discuss it varies within each city itself, making it much more difficult to solve. 

Going forward, I might choose to visualize the Twitter data in something other than a word cloud, for a better, more in-depth analysis of individual tweets. I would also expand the twitter searches to other major cities in the U.S. to get a fuller picture. Expectation-wise, the results of this exercise are pretty in line with what I assumed.
